Realm: [[Shadowfell]]

## History

"Distant from, but ultimately chained to, the influence of the Raven Queen, Novaria started as the babblings of a madman, a Pocket realm collectively conjoured by disreputable mages for generations, then as things do this hideaway came to light. Witsend the Jester of Yore was their monicker when things unraveled for Astorian Warlocks.

A dark and brooding realm, perhaps a reflection of the twisted minds that bore it into being. The inhabitants, Shadar-Kai and other races native to the shadowfell eventually claimed this conspicuously empty nation. It was assumed initially that these inhabitants were simply other conjuration enthusiasts taking a step away from whatever pressed upon them a need for such an expensive and involved dalliance as to leave their home plane. Eventually however idle communication or a wizard appearing in reposesssed home made it necessary for questions and inquiries to be made. With some measure of surprise and indeed for most, pride or fear the wizards saw no other course than to offer their services and acquiesce a portion of the realm, in exchange for staunch secrecy.

>Many, many generations later Novaria became a bastion for unfettered magics. This was not without its sins, as with any number of secrets, lives paid the way of magical progress in these streets. Formally an Academy was created, a sort of parody of the Wizarding academy outside."

Novaria is a group more-so than a place. Where Skia grew up was the longest standing Novaria in recorded history, around 300 years depending on whom you ask for an estimate, the Fae who have the longevity but not the propensity to measure such things might give a riddle more likely than a figure, such is their curious fashion, one that has wormed its way into the local culture. A cold and stern land, nothing is given freely. The closest thing would be to place bets of service on outcomes (typically grim by nature, who would die of what and the toll of a plague or invasion), otherwise a strictly enforced barter system is observed. Nothing should grow in Shadowfell rightfully, its not necessarily a place meant to facilitate such a civilization, where Novarians were forced to retreate in the Collapse of Ardenheim, with the Invasion of Sauxsiun. Regardless of the lack of sunlight many curious widly uncatagorised and unknown plants and fauna can be observed. For those of means food and drink is simply conjoured, enough to get by, Feasts are unheard of, as any displays of excess is a foolish endeavour akin to promoting yourself something worth carving up and sharing around. The cold sunless skies give a feeling of eternal winter, or at least autumn, the magically created sorces of light that dot the streets and roads producing no heat. That said it is not without its industry, as the ash that rains down on most days have curious and simply put arcane properties and obsidan deposits dot the rare hillsides.
