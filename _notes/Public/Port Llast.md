**Port Llast** (formerly **Grath's Hold**) was a town in the [Sword Coast North](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Sword_Coast_North "Sword Coast North") that stood on the [[High Road]] some 35 miles (56 kilometers) north of [[Neverwinter]] It was a small town of 700 folk mainly known for its skilled stonecutters and excellent harbor—a small bay sheltered by a high, rocky spit, with a fine beach and inlet. The port was overlooked by cliffs on which boulder-hurling siege engines were placed. Port Llast was ruled by a First Captain, and was closely allied to [[Neverwinter]] (largely for protection from [[Luskan]], who desired a more southerly harbor for its warships).
